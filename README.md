## Shulte Table

Code in javascript file generates 5x5 shulte table for mind training exercises. For using it just open sh1.html in browser. There will be rendered canvas with 25 cells table. Next look at center cell and try to find all numbers in range from smallest to biggest. Do not move ur eyes from center of page, just try to see numbers by peripheral vision.
